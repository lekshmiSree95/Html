    <p>HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is a set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the internet. The markup tells web browsers how words and images should be displayed on a webpage.HyperText is the method by which internet users navigate the web. By clicking on special text called hyperlinks, users are brought to new pages. The use of hyper means it is not linear, so users can go anywhere on the internet simply by clicking on the available links. Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside of them; they mark it as a specific type of text. For example, markup text could come in the form of boldface or italicized type to draw specific attention to a word or phrase.</p>
